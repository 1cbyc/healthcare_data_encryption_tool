# healthcare_data_encryption_tool

building this data encryption tool that encrypts healthcare data to protect patient information.

i intend to implement AES or RSA encryption
And I would get a way, maybe a working user interface for users to input data and also receive encrypted output by the way.

in otherwords, this tool encrypts healthcare data to protect patient information using AES or RSA encryption algorithms.

### Since it is open source, let me show you how to get it running:

1. **Just install the dependencies i added**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **then, run the py app**: `python3 run.py`
